1- Pyramic Tic-Tac-Toe
The game board is shaped like a pyramid. Five squares make the base, then three, then one. Players
take turns marking Xs and Os as in traditional tic-tac-toe.
Winning: The first player to get three-in-a-row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.

2- Four-in-a-row
You will recognize four-in-a row as a two-dimensional version of the classic game, Connect Four.
The game board consists of a 7 x 6 grid. Seven columns of six squares each. Instead of dropping
counters as in Connect Four, players mark the grid with Xs and Os as in tic-tac-toe.
Rules: The first player places an X in the bottom square of any column. Taking turns, players make
their mark in any column, as long as it is in the lowest square possible. See image below for an
example of possible first six moves.
Winning: The first player to get four-in-a-row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.

3- 5 x 5 Tic Tac Toe
This tic-tac-toe variation is played on a 5 x 5 grid.
As in the traditional game, players are Xs or Os.
Rules: Players take turns placing an X or an O in one of the squares until all the squares
except on are filled. (Each player has 12 turns for a total of 24 squares.)
Winning: Count the number of three-in-a-rows each player has. Sequences can be vertically,
horizontally, or diagonally. Whoever has the most wins.

4- Word Tic-tac-toe
Word Tic-tac-toe is an innovative twist on the classic Tictac-toe game.
Instead of using "X" or "O", players place letters on a 3x3 grid to form valid words.
This version adds a linguistic challenge to the traditional game mechanics.
Players aim to form a valid word with the letters they place on the board, Words can be formed
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Rules: Each player takes turns placing one letter on the board.
A player must try to form a valid word with each move. 
Players can build upon existing letters to form words, provided that the resulting sequence is a valid word.
Winning: The game is won by forming a valid word horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If the
board fills up without a valid word being formed, the game ends in a draw.
Additional Details:
A file named dic.txt will be provided, containing all valid 3-letter words. Your win-checking
function should efficiently search this file to determine if a valid word is formed after each move.

5- Numerical Tic-Tac-Toe
Numerical Tic-Tac-Toe offers a mathematical twist to
the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Instead of the traditional
"X" and "O", players use numbers to add an element of
strategic calculation. The objective is to achieve a sum
of 15 with three numbers in a row, column, or diagonal.
Rules: Player 1 typically starts and uses odd numbers
(1, 3, 5, 7, 9), while Player 2 uses even numbers (2, 4, 6,
8). Players alternate turns, placing one number in an
empty cell on the board. Each number can only be used
once.
Winning: A player wins by placing three numbers in a row, column, or diagonal that add up to 15.
If all cells are filled without achieving the sum of 15 in any line, the game ends in a draw.

6- 4 x 4 Tic-Tac-Toe
4 x 4 Tic-Tac-Toe is an extended version of the classic game, played on a larger board with more
complex strategies. Each player has four tokens and aims to
align three tokens in a row to win. This game introduces new
movement rules and strategic depth to the traditional Tic-Tac-
Toe. The game is played on a 4x4 grid. Each player has four
tokens. Tokens are placed in specific starting positions: two
tokens on opposite sides of the board for each player. (as
shown in image).
Rules: Players alternate turns, moving one of their tokens to
an immediately adjacent open square. Tokens can be moved
horizontally or vertically but not diagonally. Tokens may not jump over other tokens. The goal is to
align three of your tokens in a row. This can be achieved
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Winning: The first player to get three tokens in a row wins
the game. The alignment can be in any direction: horizontal,
vertical, or diagonal.

7- Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is an expansion of the
classic game, where players engage in a metagame
of Tic Tac Toe within a 3x3 grid of
smaller Tic Tac Toe boards. The goal is to win
three smaller games in a row to claim victory
on the main board, adding layers of complexity
to the traditional game. The game is played on
a large 3x3 grid, where each cell contains a
smaller 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board.
Rules: Player 1 starts by choosing any of the
nine smaller Tic Tac Toe boards to play on.
Players alternate turns, playing Tic Tac Toe on
the smaller boards. The winner of each smaller
board claims that space on the main board. The
winner of the smaller board replaces that board
with their symbol (X or O) on the main board.
Winning: The first player to win three smaller boards in a row on the main 3x3 grid wins the
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game. The winning row on the main board can be horizontal, vertical, or
diagonal.

8- Toe Tac Tic
known as Inverse Tic Tac Toe, is a unique twist on the
classic game. In this version, the objective is to avoid
getting three marks in a row. The game flips the traditional
win condition on its head, making every move a strategic
decision to prevent losing.
Rules: The game is played on a standard 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe
grid. The goal is to avoid placing three of your marks in a
row, column, or diagonal. The player who ends up with
three marks in a row loses the game. If all cells are filled
without either player aligning three marks in a row, the
game ends in a draw.
